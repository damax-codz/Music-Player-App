            Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
(I'll-I'll) I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
(You-you) you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
(I'll-I'll) I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
(You-you) you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
See, I ain't really inna the verbal
My broski strapped, no Dyke, no Virgil
The van might buss that circle
See, I'm tryna blow off this music ting
And pray that I end up commercial
And 'bout time that I make some records
Show them why that I go universal
('Cause I can't) 'cause I can't get stuck in the ends
I need me a yard with a big ass fence
Lambo truck or Mercedes Benz
No fake love, no need to pretend
If I cut you off, it's straight intent
Guys out here tryna drill and repent
Same bad B that I need in defence
The J1's coulda been A1, but I can't follow the latest trends
Broski might handle the can and let off shots, 'cause the bullets bisexual
(It's really) it's really for them boy there, can definitely hit that bitch right next to you
Everytime I rap on the beat, gotta show them why man feels presentable
And chicks love pick and choose their guys like a video game collectable
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
(I'll-I'll) I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
(You-you) you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
(I'll-I'll) I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
(You-you) you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Bare man change, people fake (mm-mm)
The world so fucked nowadays, I don't trust no one
'Cause they lied to my face (they lied)
I can't stop working, we all die one day
(Back) back then, I was lonely (lonely)
I ain't got time for these phonies (phonies)
Got my bro like Zack got Cody
I'm a top boy like Modie (ah-ah)
Anti-social, I don't like to socialize
They cap on the net, that's social lies
When brodie died, I cried, that's real life
I feel a way, I just don't feel right
Could've been homeless
My heart so cold, it's frozen
DTB, I find it hard to open
I've been busy livin' life in the moment
Reason why I ain't got time to lotion
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
(I'll-I'll) I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
(You-you) you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
