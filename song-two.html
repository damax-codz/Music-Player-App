            [Intro]
(Mokuba)

[Chorus]
I got commitment issues but I'm tryna fix that for you
If I can’t afford that bag that you want then I would lick that for you, huh
I wanna be there for you, I knew that the day I saw you
Too many times we argue, sorry for all of the names I called you
Shoulda never called you a bitch but I did, now you're pissed, tryna cut my clothes (Don't do that)
Should have deleted that text, then you wouldn’t have known that I fucked those hoes (Alright)
Don't act like you care how I feel, don't act like you care how I feel, you don't
Don't like how you act so spoilt, you start move mad when I tell you "No"

[Verse 1]
But I wanna make it known (Alright)
I gotta take my time with love, so we gotta take it slow (Tek time)
I'm not used to this type of stuff but I can still make you moan (Anytime)
Anytime that you want, I can lay that (Lay that)
You wait on the day that I say "I love you too" but I just can't say that (Say that)
You want that bag, I'ma hit that trap, in a week I’ll make that purchase (I’ll buy that)
One touch make her leg start shake, make her legs start shake like I make you nervous
Every time that I rap 'bout hoes, I know that you hate those lyrics
I don’t believe in love but that doesn't mean I don't take you serious

[Chorus]
I got commitment issues but I'm tryna fix that for you
If I can’t afford that bag that you want then I would lick that for you, huh
I wanna be there for you, I knew that the day I saw you
Too many times we argue, sorry for all of the names I called you
Shoulda never called you a bitch but I did, now you're pissed, tryna cut my clothes (Don't do that)
Should have deleted that text, then you wouldn't have known that I fucked those hoes (Alright)
Don't act like you care how I feel, don't act like you care how I feel, you don't
Don't like how you act so spoilt, you start move mad when I tell you "No"
[Verse 2]
I got commitment issues (I do)
I know that your ex still miss you (I know)
You can't get enough of my love 'cause I give you a fuck that your ex can't give you, ha
Send the location (Skrrt), I'm speeding 'cause I got no patience
Twenty bags on trainers, think I'm famous, I got a lot of hoes though lately (Ah)
I get a lot of dough though lately, and I get paid on the promo lately
A lot of fake love in the air, can't go nowhere on my solo lately
Me and her just argue daily, she knows that I trap so her marge don't rate me
When I don't text back, I ain't with a yat, I'm in the bando, baby

[Chorus]
I got commitment issues but I'm tryna fix that for you
If I can't afford that bag that you want then I would lick that for you, huh
I wanna be there for you, I knew that the day I saw you
Too many times we argue, sorry for all of the names I called you
Shoulda never called you a bitch but I did, now you're pissed, tryna cut my clothes (Don't do that)
Should have deleted that text, then you wouldn't have known that I fucked those hoes (Alright)
Don't act like you care how I feel, don't act like you care how I feel, you don't
Don't like how you act so spoilt, you start move mad when I tell you "No"
